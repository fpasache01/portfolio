    "aboutDetail":"Hello, my name is Felipe Pasache Rivas. I am a fullstack developer with a focus on backend development. I have experience with legacy application migrations and poorly implemented applications. I have experience providing application support; I worked resolving issues in banking projects, which has given me a keen eye for finding errors. As you can see, I have significant experience in corporate environments. Personally, I use Linux for development because I find resource and package management within that environment more convenient. If your company requires Windows, there's no problem; I can set up a Windows VM and continue working without issues. I have experience as a technical leader managing projects in both private and public environments. Additionally, I am very interested in learning about lower-level programming. I'm not an expert, but I enjoy exploring compilers and recompilers. The last thing I was doing was figuring out how to recompile an N64 game in C++ to then convert it into a native PC game. I really like retro things, which is why I decided to use that style for this portfolio.",
