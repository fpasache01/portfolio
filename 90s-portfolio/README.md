Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub Profile README üëã
This README acts as a dynamic overview of my professional journey and technical expertise, much like a living portfolio. Here, you'll find insights into my skills, experience, and what drives me in the world of software development.

üöÄ About Me
I'm a Software Developer with over 7 years of hands-on experience in full-stack development, with a strong passion for backend technologies. My toolkit includes robust knowledge in .NET Core/Framework, C#, Java (Spring Boot), Python, VB, SQL Server, and Azure. I pride myself on being adaptable to various architectures and solutions, backed by strong analytical and problem-solving abilities. I also have a proven track record of collaborating with and leading development teams.

Currently, I'm on the lookout for Intermediate Developer positions, particularly those conducted fully in English. I'm actively leveling up my English proficiency (currently B1) through daily practice to ensure seamless communication. I'm in Canada on a working holiday visa for a year, with plans to activate my work permit by July 2025. Right now, I'm a visitor working remotely.
